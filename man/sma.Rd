\title{Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA)}
\usage{
sma(img, endm, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{Optical images. It could be RasterStack or RasterBrick.}

\item{endm}{Endmembers must be a matrix or data.frame and with more than one endmember.
Rows represent the endmembers and columns represent the spectral bands.  The number
of bands must be greater than the number of endmembers.}

\item{verbose}{This paramater is Logical. It Prints progress messages during execution.}
}
\description{
The SMA assumes that the energy received, within the field of vision of the
remote sensor, can be considered as the sum of the energies received from each
dominant endmember. This function addresses a Linear Mixing Model.

\section{Details}{

A regression analysis is used to obtain the fractions. In least squares
inversion algorithms, the common objective is to estimate abundances that
minimize the squared error between the actual spectrum and the estimated spectrum.
The values of the fractions will be between 0 and 1.
