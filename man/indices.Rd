\usage{
indices(
  index,
  blue = NULL,
  green = NULL,
  red = NULL,
  nir = NULL,
  redEdge = NULL,
  swir = NULL,
  coefs = list(Lsavi = 0.5, G = 2.5, C1 = 6, C2 = 7.5, Levi = 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{Character, index name.}

\item{blue}{Blue band, raster object.}

\item{green}{Green band, raster object.}

\item{red}{Red band, raster object.}

\item{nir}{Near-infrared band, raster object.}

\item{redEdge}{Red-edge band, raster object.}

\item{swir}{Short-wave-infrared band, raster object.}

\item{coefs}{List of coefficients to be used in some indices (Lsavi = 0.5, G = 2.5,
C1 = 6, C2 = 7.5, Levi = 1).}

\description{
This function allows to obtain several remote sensing spectral indices in the optical
domain.
}
\note{
Currently implemented for satellites such as Landsat-4 TM, Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+,
Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2, and any other sensor who has the appropriate bands. It is
possible to obtain spectral indices through digital number or top of atmosphere reflectance
(toa), however in order to calculate indices such as SAVI or EVI, the the data must be in
surface reflectance.

\examples{
library(ForesToolboxRS)
library(raster)

# Load an example dataset
data(img_l8)

# Obtain bands
nirBand <- img_l8[[4]]
redBand <- img_l8[[3]]

# Obtain NDVI
ndvi <- indices(index = "NDVI", nir = nirBand, red = redBand)
plot(ndvi)
