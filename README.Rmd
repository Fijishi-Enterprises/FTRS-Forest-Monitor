# Introduction

**ForesToolboxRS** is an R package providing a variety of tools and
algorithms for the processing and analysis of satellite images for the
various applications of Remote Sensing for Earth Observations. All
implemented algorithms are based on scientific publications.

**The PVts-Beta approach**, a non-seasonal detection approach, is
implemented in this package and can read time series, vector, matrix,
and raster data. Some functions of this package are intended to show, on
the one hand, some progress in methods for mapping deforestation and
forest degradation, and on the other hand, to provide some tools (not
yet available) for routine analysis of remotely detected data. Tools for
calibration of unsupervised and supervised algorithms through various
calibration approaches are some of the functions embedded in this
package. Therefore we sincerely hope that **ForesToolboxRS** can facilitate different analyses and simple and robust processes in satellite images

# Installation

To install the latest development version directly from the GitHub
repository. Before running **ForesToolboxRS**, it is necessary to
install the **remotes** package:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("ytarazona/ForesToolboxRS")
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
```

# Examples

## 1. Breakpoint in an NDFI series (**`pvts`** function)

Here an Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) between 2000 and
2019 (28 data) was used. One NDFI for each year was obtained. The idea is to detect a change in 2008 (position 19). The NDFI value ranges from -1 to 1.

```{r README-2}
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
# NDFI series
ndfi <- c(0.86, 0.93, 0.97, 0.91, 0.95, 0.96, 0.91,
          0.88, 0.92, 0.89, 0.90, 0.89, 0.91, 0.92,
          0.89, 0.90, 0.92, 0.84, 0.46, 0.13, 0.12,
          0.18, 0.14, 0.25, 0.17, 0.15, 0.18, 0.20)
          
# Plot
plot(ndfi, pch = 20, xlab = "Index", ylab = "NDFI value")
lines(ndfi, col = "gray45")
```


### 1.1 Applying a smoothing (the **`smootH()`** function)

Before detecting a breakpoint, it is necessary to apply smoothing to
remove any existing outliers. So, weâll use the **`smootH()`** function
from the **ForesToolboxRS** package. The mathematical approach of this
method of removing outliers implies the non-modification of the first
and last values of the historical series.

If the idea is to detect changes in 2008 (position 19), then we will
smooth the data only up to that position (i.e., `ndfi[1:19]`). Letâs do
that.

```{r README-3}
ndfi_smooth <- ndfi
ndfi_smooth[1:19] <- smootH(ndfi[1:19])

# Let's plot the real series
plot(ndfi, pch = 20, xlab = "Index", ylab = "NDFI value")
lines(ndfi, col = "gray45", lty = 3)
# Let's plot the smoothed series
lines(ndfi_smooth, col = "blue", ylab = "NDFI value", xlab = "Time")
points(ndfi_smooth, pch = 20, col = "blue")
```


> **Note**: You can change the detection threshold if you need to. 

### 1.1 Breakpoint using a specific index (vector)

To detect changes, either we can have a vector (using a specific
index/position) or a time series as input. Letâs first detect changes
with a vector, a then with a time series.

We use the output of the **`smootH()`** function (**`ndfi_smooth()`**).

Parameters:

-   **x**: smoothed series preferably to optimize detection
-   **startm**: monitoring year, index 19 (i.e., year 2008)
-   **endm**: year of final monitoring, index 19 (i.e., also year 2008)
-   **threshold**: detection threshold (for NDFI series we will use 5).
    If you are using PV series, NDVI and EVI series you can use 5, 3 and 3
    respectively. Please see [Tarazona et
    al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326)
    for more details.

```{r README-4}
# Detect changes in 2008 (position 19)
cd <- pvts(x = ndfi_smooth, startm = 19, endm = 19, threshold = 5)
plot(cd)
```


### 1.3 Breakpoint using Time Series

Parameters:

-   **x**: smoothed series preferably to optimize detection
-   **startm**: monitoring year, in this case year 2008.
-   **endm**: year of final monitoring, also year 2008.
-   **threshold**: detection threshold (for NDFI series we will use 5).
    If you are using PV series, NDVI and EVI series you can use 5, 3 and 3
    respectively. Please see [Tarazona et
    al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326)
    for more details.

```{r README-5}
# LetÂ´s create a time series of the variable "ndfi"
ndfi_ts <- ts(ndfi, start = 1990, end = 2017, frequency = 1)

# Applying a smoothing
ndfi_smooth <- ndfi_ts
ndfi_smooth[1:19] <- smootH(ndfi_ts[1:19])

# Detect changes in 2008
cd <- pvts(x = ndfi_ts, startm = 2008, endm = 2008,  threshold = 5)
plot(cd)
```

For this tutorial, the same images was used.

#### 3.1 Applying K-means

Parameters:

# Read raster
image <- stack("LC08_232066_20190727_SR.tif")

# Classification with K-means
classKmeans <- rkmeans(img = image, k = 4, algo = "MacQueen")
```

```{r README-12}

This function allows to calibrate the *kmeans* algorithm. It is possible
to obtain the best value and the best embedded algorithm in kmeans. If
we want to find the optimal value of (clusters or classes), so we must
put as an argument of the function. Here, we are finding k for which the
intra-class inertia is stabilized.

-   **iter.max**: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Strictly
    related to k-means

    Algorithms embedded in k-means
    <!--JN: Algorithms embedded in k-means???-->
-   **iter**: Iterations number to obtain the best k value

```{r README-13, warning=FALSE}
# Elbow method
