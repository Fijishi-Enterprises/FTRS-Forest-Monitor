# Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing

This repository is part of the paper "Fusing Landsat and SAR data for mapping tropical deforestation through machine learning classification and the PVts-beta non-seasonal detection approach" submitted to [Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ujrs20/current).

# Introduction

**ForesToolboxRS** is a R package that was created to provide a variety of tools and algorithms for the processing and analysis of satallite images for the different applications of Remote Sensing for Earth Observation. All implemented algorithms are based on scientific publications. **The PVts-Beta approach**, a non-seasonal detection approach, is implemented in this package and is capable of reading time series, vector, matrix and raster data. Some functions of this package are intended to show, on the one hand, some progress in methods for mapping deforestation, forest degradation, and on the other hand, to provide some tools (not yet available) for routine analysis of remotely detected data. Tools for calibration of unsupervised and supervised algorithms through various calibration approaches are some of the functions embedded in this package. Therefore we sincerely hope that **ForesToolboxRS** can facilitate different analyses and simple and robust processes in satellite images.

# Installation

To install the latest development version directly from the GitHub repository. Before running **ForesToolboxRS**, it is necessary to intall the **devtools** package. Then, let's do this:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("ytarazona/ForesToolboxRS")
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
```

# Examples

## 1. Breakpoint in an NDFI series (**`pvts`** function)

Here an Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) between 2000 and 2019 (28 data), one NDFI for each year, and we will detect a change in 2008 (position 19). The NDFI value ranges from -1 to 1.

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
# NDFI series
ndfi <- c(0.86,0.93,0.97,0.91,0.95,0.96,0.91,0.88,0.92,0.89,0.90,0.89,0.91,
          0.92,0.89,0.90,0.92,0.84,0.46,0.13, 0.12,0.18,0.14,0.25,0.17,0.15,0.18,0.20)
          
# Plot
plot(ndfi, pch = 20, xlab = "Index", ylab = "NDFI value")
lines(ndfi, col = "gray45")
```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ndfi_serie1.png" width = 90%/>

### 1.1 Applying a smoothing (**`smootH`** function)

Before detecting a breakpoint, it is necessary to apply a smoothing to remove outliers. So, we'll use the **smootH** function from the **ForesToolboxRS** package. The mathematical approach of this method of removing outliers implies the non-modification of the first and last values of the historical series.

If the idea is to detect changes in 2008 (position 19), then we will smooth the data only up to that position (i.e. ndfi[1:19]). Let's do that.

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
ndfi_smooth <- ndfi
ndfi_smooth[1:19] <- smootH(ndfi[1:19])

# Let's plot the real series
plot(ndfi, pch = 20, xlab = "Index", ylab = "NDFI value")
lines(ndfi, col = "gray45", lty = 3)
# Let's plot the smoothed series
lines(ndfi_smooth, col = "blue", ylab = "NDFI value", xlab = "Time")
points(ndfi_smooth, pch = 20, col = "blue")
```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ndfi_serie_smooth2.jpg" width = 90%/>

> **Note**: You can change the detection threshold if you need to. 

### 1.1 Breakpoint using a specific Index (vector)

To detect changes, either we can have a vector (using a specific index (position)) or a time series as input. Let's first detect changes with a vector, a then with a time series. 

Let's use the output of the *smootH* function (**ndfi_smooth**).

Parameters:
- **x**: smoothed series preferably to optimize detections.
- **startm**: monitoring year, index 19 (i.e., year 2008)
- **endm**: year of final monitoring, index 19 (i.e., also year 2008)
- **threshold**: detection threshold (for NDFI series we will use 5). If you are using PV series, NDVI or EVI series you can use 5, 3 or 3 respectively. Please see [Tarazona et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326) for more details.

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
# Detect changes in 2008 (position 19)
cd <- pvts(x = ndfi_smooth, startm = 19, endm = 19, threshold = 5)
plot(cd)
```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ndfi_serie_pvtsVect3.png" width = 90%/>

### 1.3 Breakpoint using Time Series

Parameters:
- **x**: smoothed series preferably to optimize detections.
- **startm**: monitoring year, in this case year 2008.
- **endm**: year of final monitoring, also year 2008.
- **threshold**: detection threshold (for NDFI series we will use 5). If you are using PV series, NDVI or EVI series you can use 5, 3 or 3 respectively. Please see [Tarazona et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326) for more details.

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
# LetÂ´s create a time series of the variable "ndfi"
ndfi_ts <- ts(ndfi, start = 1990, end = 2017, frequency = 1)

# Applying a smoothing
ndfi_smooth <- ndfi_ts
ndfi_smooth[1:19] <- smootH(ndfi_ts[1:19])

# Detect changes in 2008
cd <- pvts(x = ndfi_ts, startm = 2008, endm = 2008,  threshold = 5)
plot(cd)
```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ndfi_serie_pvtsTs4.png" width = 90%/>

### 1.4 Breakpoint Not Detected

Parameters:
- **x**: smoothed series preferably to optimize detections.
- **startm**: monitoring year, index 16 (i.e., year 2005)
- **endm**: year of final monitoring, index 16 (i.e., also year 2005)
- **threshold**: detection threshold (for NDFI series we will use 5). If you are using PV series, NDVI or EVI series you can use 5, 3 or 3 respectively. Please see [Tarazona et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18305326) for more details.

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))

# Detect changes in 2005
cd <- pvts(x = ndfi_smooth, startm = 2005, endm = 2005,  threshold = 5)
plot(cd)
```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ndfi_serie_pvtsVect5.png" width = 90%/>

#### 2.2 Calibrating with Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (**`calmla`** function)

**`ForesToolboxRS`** has several approaches to calibrate machine learning algorithms such as **Set-Approach**, **Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**, **Cross-Validation (k-fold)** and **Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV)**. 

Parameters:
- **img**: RasterStack (Landsat-8 OLI).
- **endm**: Signatures.
- **model**: c("svm", "randomForest", "naiveBayes", "knn"). Machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbors.
- **training_split**: 80.
- **approach**: "MCCV".
- **iter**: 10.

```R
cal_ml <- calmla(img = image, endm = sig, model = c("svm", "randomForest", "naiveBayes", "knn"),
                 training_split = 80, approach = "MCCV", iter = 10)
```

```R
# Calibration result
plot(cal_ml$svm_mccv, main = "Monte Carlo Cross-Validation calibration", 
     col = "darkmagenta", type = "b", ylim=c(0, 0.4), ylab="Error between 0 and 1", 
     xlab = "Number of iterations")
lines(cal_ml$randomForest_mccv, col = "red", type = "b")
lines(cal_ml$naiveBayes_mccv, col = "green", type = "b")

```
The output:

<img src="docs/figures/ReadmeImage3-1.jpg" width = 90%/>

### 3. Unsupervised classification in Remote Sensing (**`rkmeans`** function)

For this tutorial, Landsat-8 OLI image and signatures were used. Download the data [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xf1A84fJN20eC578GwwOsVSuoxLuCRGJ/view?usp=sharing).

#### 3.1 Applying K-means

Parameters:
- **img**: RasterStack (Landsat 8 OLI).
- **k**: the number of clusters.
- **algo**: "MacQueen".

```R
suppressMessages(library(ForesToolboxRS))
suppressMessages(library(raster))

# Read raster
image_path <- "your/folder/LC08_232066_20190727_SR.tif"
image <- stack(image_path)

# Classification with K-means
classKmeans <- rkmeans(img = image, k = 4, algo = "MacQueen")
```

```R
# Plotting classification
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(3, 4, 3, 3))
# Landsat-8 image
plotRGB(image, 6,5,2, stretch="lin")
# Classification
colmap <- c("#0000FF","#00FF00","#228B22", "#FF1493")
plot(classKmeans, main = "K-means Classification", col = colmap, axes = F)
```

The output:

<img src="docs/figures/Readme_Image2-2.jpg" width = 100%/>

#### 3.2 Calibrating k-means (**`calkmeans`** function)

This function allows to calibrate the *kmeans* algorithm. It is possible to obtain the best \code{k} value and the best embedded algorithm in kmeans. If we want to find the optimal value of \code{k} (clusters or classes), so we must put \code{k = NULL} as an argument of the function. Here, we are finding k for which the intra-class inertia is stabilized.

Parameters:
- **img**: RasterStack (Landsat 8 OLI).
- **k**: the number of clusters.
- **iter.max**: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Strictly related to k-means.
- **algo**: It can be "Hartigan-Wong", "Lloyd", "Forgy" or "MacQueen". Algorithms embedded in k-means.
- **iter**: Iterations number to obtain the best k value.

```R
# Elbow method
best_k <- calkmeans(img = image, k = NULL, iter.max = 10,
                    algo = c("Hartigan-Wong", "Lloyd", "Forgy", "MacQueen"), iter = 20)
```

```R
plot(best_k)
```
